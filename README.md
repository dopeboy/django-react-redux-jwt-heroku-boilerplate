# django-react-redux-jwt-heroku-boilerplate

This is a fork of Seedstars' brilliant [django-react-redux-jwt-base boilerplate project](https://github.com/Seedstars/django-react-redux-jwt-base). It is adapted to be deployed on Heroku. There's a couple other changes I've made based on my preferences. I didn't make a formal fork because it's different enough to merit its own repo.

Here are the major changes:

1. Added `Procfile` 
2. Added `runtime.txt`
3. Added another target to `package.json` called `postinstall`. Heroku runs this after deployment.
4. Heroku expects a `requirements.txt` in the root. I've copied over `py-requirements/base.txt` to it.
5. The local environment now uses a postgres instance rather than SQLite. See `dev.py` in the settings folder to see all credentials.
6. Semantic-UI is included. For an example, see the `ProtectedView`. I've decided to check a compiled version into the `static/` folder so user beware. Long term, this should be replaced with a library of React components for Semantic.
7. Sentry logging is turned off on production and replaced with standard local logging.
8. Not using `scripts/static_validate_backend.sh`. Just using pep8 through vim.

Make sure to setup postgres on Heroku and have your buildpacks in order:
```
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku/nodejs
heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/python
```

And set the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable:

```
heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=djangoreactredux.settings.prod
```

Hope it helps.

## Note

For some reason, Heroku doesn't like the node & npm versions set on the first commit. The `postinstall` command will fail. So on the first commit, comment those out. Put them back in (and make sure they match the versions on your dev environment) from the second commit onwards.
